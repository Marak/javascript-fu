##the three main disciplines of javascript-fu

### isFu - the art of type checking

isFu methods, such as isDefined() and isNumber() will accept <em>anything</em> as an argument and gracefully return true or false depending on if the arguments match the type you have checked for

### toFu - the art of monkey punching

toFu methods, such as toDate(), toNumber(), toPlural(), toOrdinal(), toLink() will accept <em>anything</em> as an argument and aggressively attempt to coerce the value into the type you have specified 

### getFu - the art of getting

getFu methods such as getDay(), getMonth(), getMinutes() mimic existing getters
